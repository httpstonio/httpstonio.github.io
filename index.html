            <p>My name is Antonio and I am a college student at the University
                of South Carolina studying Integrated Information Technology. 
                I first found interest in detailing when I was a kid helping my dad
                detail his cars. Overtime he taught me better techniques along 
                with showing me proper tools and chemicals to use to bring 
                cars back to their original state. This interest grew with me and 
                led me to creating my own small business where I work to bring 
                peoples cars to a clean state. </p>
